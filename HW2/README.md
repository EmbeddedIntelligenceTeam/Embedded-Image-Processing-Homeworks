## 1. Project Aim and Scope

The primary objective of this project is to implement foundational digital image processing algorithms from scratch in C, running on an `STM32F446RE` microcontroller. This assignment focuses on analyzing and manipulating images at the pixel level to perform statistical analysis, contrast enhancement, and spatial filtering.

The project covers four main topics:
* **Histogram Generation:** Calculating the intensity distribution of an image.
* **Histogram Equalization (HE):** Automatically enhancing image contrast based on its histogram.
* **2D Convolution:** Implementing a linear spatial filter framework for:
    * **Low-Pass Filtering** (Blurring)
    * **High-Pass Filtering** (Edge Detection)
* **Median Filtering:** Implementing a non-linear filter for noise reduction, specifically "salt-and-pepper" noise.

All operations are performed on a **128x128 pixel, 8-bit grayscale** image.

##  Q1 — Histogram Formation (40 pts)

### 🔹 Objective  
Importing an image from the computer, computing its histogram, and displaying the histogram distribution through the Memory Browser in STM32CubeIDE

---

### 🔹 STM32 code 
```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
#include "lib_image.h"
#include "lib_serialimage.h"
#include "string.h"
/* USER CODE END Includes */
```

---

### 🔹 Execution Steps  
1. Open **Command Prompt (CMD)**  
2. Install Pillow library:  
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```
3. Place your image (`lena_gray.png`) in the same directory as `convert.py`  
4. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python convert.py
   ```
5. The file `image_data.h` will be generated automatically and placed under:  
   ```
   python image converter/
   ```
6. Move the generated `.h` file into STM32 project path:  
   ```
   HW1/STM32CubeIDE/Core/Inc/
   ```

### 🔹 Results  

 **Original Grayscale Image:**  
`python image converter/lena_gray.png`

##  Q2 — Intensity Transformations (60 pts)

### 🔹 Objective  
Implement and verify pixel intensity transformations in STM32CubeIDE by observing memory values.

---

### 🔹 STM32 Project Setup  
Add the generated header file into your STM32 project includes:

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
#include "image_data.h"
#include <math.h>
/* USER CODE END Includes */
```

---

### 🔹 STM32 Code (main.c)
```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
volatile unsigned char dummy_pixel = my_image_data[0];

#define IMAGE_WIDTH  128
#define IMAGE_HEIGHT 128
#define IMAGE_SIZE   (IMAGE_WIDTH * IMAGE_HEIGHT)

unsigned char output_image[IMAGE_SIZE];

// 2a Negative Image Transformation
/* for (int i = 0; i < IMAGE_SIZE; i++) {
     output_image[i] = 255 - my_image_data[i];
 }*/

// 2b Thresholding Image Transformation
/*int threshold_value = 128;
for (int i = 0; i < IMAGE_SIZE; i++) {
    unsigned char r = my_image_data[i];
    if (r > threshold_value) {
        output_image[i] = 255; // greater than threshold → white
    } else {
        output_image[i] = 0;   // smaller → black
    }
}*/

// 2c Gamma Correction Transformation
/*float gamma_value = 1.0/3.0; // Gamma value
for (int i = 0; i < IMAGE_SIZE; i++) {
    float r_normalized = (float)my_image_data[i] / 255.0;
    float s_normalized = powf(r_normalized, gamma_value);
    output_image[i] = (unsigned char)(s_normalized * 255.0);
}*/

// 2d Piecewise Linear Transformation
/*int r1 = 80;
int s1 = 0;
int r2 = 170;
int s2 = 255;
float slope = (float)(s2 - s1) / (float)(r2 - r1);

for (int i = 0; i < IMAGE_SIZE; i++) {
    unsigned char r = my_image_data[i];
    if (r <= r1) {
        output_image[i] = s1;
    }
    else if (r >= r2) {
        output_image[i] = s2;
    }
    else {
        output_image[i] = (unsigned char)((float)(r - r1) * slope + (float)s1);
    }
}*/

// Prevent optimization
volatile unsigned char dummy_output_pixel = output_image[0];
/* USER CODE END 2 */
```

### 🔹 How to Run  
1. Uncomment one transformation block at a time (2a–2d).  
2. Build and run in **Debug Mode**.  
3. Open the **Memory Window** and monitor pixel value changes.

##  Observations  
- Pixel value distributions in **Memory Window** verified that transformations behaved correctly.  
- The system successfully mapped grayscale data to transformed arrays in STM32 memory.  
- All results corresponded with expected theoretical transformations.

- **Outcome:** Every transformation (2a–2d) visually confirmed in memory.
